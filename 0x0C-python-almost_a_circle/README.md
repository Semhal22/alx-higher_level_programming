# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## This directory contains tasks covering topics so far about Python like Import, Exceptions, Class etc.... Also new concept args and kwargs is introduced</p>

### 1. Base class
- Write the first class Base. This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)

### 2. First Rectangle
- Write the class Rectangle that inherits from Base

### 3. Validate attributes
- Update the class Rectangle by adding validation of all setter methods and instantiation

### 4. Area first
- Update the class Rectangle by adding the public method def area(self): that returns the area value of the Rectangle instance.
