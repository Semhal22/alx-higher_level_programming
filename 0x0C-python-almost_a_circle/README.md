# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

## This directory contains tasks covering topics so far about Python like Import, Exceptions, Class etc.... Also new concept args and kwargs is introduced</p>

### 1. Base class
- Write the first class Base. This class will be the “base” of all other classes in this project. The goal of it is to manage id attribute in all your future classes and to avoid duplicating the same code (by extension, same bugs)
